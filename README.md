Detect all physical bus stops along the route using telematic data



\# Bus Stop Detection from Telematics Data



This repository contains the code and resources for detecting bus stops using GPS telematics data. It utilizes spatial analysis and clustering algorithms to identify stopping patterns.



\## 📂 Project Structure



\- `data/`: Contains sample telematics datasets (CSV/JSON).

\- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and model experimentation and report generation.


\- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the project.
